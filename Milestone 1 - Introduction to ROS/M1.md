# Milestone 1 - Introduction to ROS

[ROS](https://www.ros.org/about-ros/) will be the main framework for your coursework and projects in this course. 
This deliverable will help you get to know about ROS and teach you how to use it. 

## Installation

**Please make sure you install ROS melodic.**

### Installation guide for Linux users

ROS is best supported for Linux users, you can follow the guide [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)

### Installation guide for Windows users

Fortunately, ROS is recently supported on Windows officially. The installation [guide](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows) is a bit long to follow and requires extra caution.
However, I believe ROS can be installed on any 64-bit Windows PCs so you can ignore the requirement **ROS for Windows requires 64-bit Windows 10 Desktop or Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.**
If you encourtered any difficulties installing ROS on Windows, try trouble-shooting using online resources.

### Installation guide for MacOS users

Although ROS is not officially supported on MacOS, there have been many successful cases of installation on MacOS. The guide is [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/macOS/Homebrew/Source). 

Alternatively, use a virtual machine by following this [guide](https://wiki.epfl.ch/roscontrol/rosinstall) offered by EPFL. 

## ROS beginner's tutorials

In addition to installing ROS, you will need to learn how to interact with the ROS framework. ROS has provided a list of [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) that you can follow.
To complete this Milestone, we suggest you complete the tutorials up to **[item 5](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes)** of **1.1 Beginner Beginner Level**.  

## Milestone Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria

To demonstrate that you have completed this Milestone, you need to be able to show that you can:
1. Initialize ROS Core via
```bash
$ roscore
```
2. List running ROS nodes which include **rosout** via
```bash
$ rosnode list
```

Evaluation will take form in video conference calls or video recordings.
