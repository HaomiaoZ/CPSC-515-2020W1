# Milestone 1 - Introduction to ROS

[ROS](https://www.ros.org/about-ros/) will be the main software framework for your coursework and projects in this course.  It serves as a middleware architecture for communicating information between sensors, computational processes, actuators, and possibly other robots.  The ROS ecosystem also includes many packages that implement common robotics tasks and interface with common sensors, networks, actuators, simulators, and visualization tools.

### Learning Goals

After completing this milestone, you will be able to

* Install ROS on your local machine.
* Execute basic ROS commands at the command line.
* Describe basic properties of the ROS architecture, such as !!!


## Step 1: Installation

ROS is an open source project with many components.  It is normally installed from source code which must be compiled on your local machine.  Please get started on this step early, because it can take several hours to get all the various packages downloaded, compiled and installed even if everything goes smoothly.

ROS can be a computational resource hog.  If you have access to multiple machines, we recommend using one with a GPU, larger screen, more memory and/or more powerful processor if possible.

ROS has a large user community.  If you run into problems, search for troubleshooting help online before posting to the course discussion forum.  !!! Do you have favourite sites for getting answers to ROS questions?

Please make sure you **install the version of ROS called [ROS Melodic Morenia](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic)** (ROS Melodic for short).  Do not install ROS 2.

Installation instructions depend on your operating system (OS).

### Installation guide for Linux users

Ubuntu Linux has been the OS of choice for ROS since the beginning, so if you have access to a machine on which you can run it natively, we recommend this choice.  Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is the favoured version for ROS Melodic.
Follow the guide [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).

### Installation guide for Windows users

ROS has recently extended official supported for Windows. The installation [guide](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows) is a bit long to follow and requires extra caution.
However, I believe ROS can be installed on any 64-bit Windows PCs so you can ignore the requirement "ROS for Windows requires 64-bit Windows 10 Desktop or Windows 10 IoT Enterprise."

### Installation guide for MacOS users

Although ROS is not officially supported on MacOS, there have been many successful cases of installation on MacOS. The guide is [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/macOS/Homebrew/Source). 

Alternatively, use a virtual machine by following this [guide](https://wiki.epfl.ch/roscontrol/rosinstall) offered by EPFL. 

## Step 2: ROS beginner's tutorials

In addition to installing ROS, you will need to learn how to interact with the ROS framework. ROS has provided a list of [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) that you can follow.
To complete this Milestone, we suggest you complete the tutorials up to **[item 5](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes)** of **1.1 Beginner Beginner Level**.  

## Milestone Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria

To demonstrate that you have completed this Milestone, you need to be able to show that you can:
1. Initialize ROS Core via
```bash
$ roscore
```
2. List running ROS nodes which include **rosout** via
```bash
$ rosnode list
```

Evaluation will take form in video conference calls or video recordings.
