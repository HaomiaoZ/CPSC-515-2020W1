# Milestone 2 - Basic Robot Simulation with Gazebo

In this Milestone, you are going to learn about [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), a physics engine that allows you to simulate your robots moving through a virtual 3D environment, and hence test your algorithms. 

### Learning Goals

After completing this milestone, you will be able to

* Demonstrate a robot controlled through ROS which moves in the Gazebo simulation.
* List common actuators deployed on robots and their properties.
* List the goals and limitations of actuation components of a robot system.

## Installation

**Ensure you have installed ROS before starting this Milestone.**  The instructions below assume you have installed ROS Melodic, but may work in other versions.

### Installation guide for Linux users

Just like ROS, Gazebo is native to Ubuntu Linux and thus best supported there. The [installation on Ubuntu](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install) is fairly straightforward.
Things to keep in mind are:
* Make sure you install Gazebo related packages that match your [ROS version](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions) (in our case ROS Melodic).
* Confirm the Gazebo GUI is working properly by reading [this page](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b2).

### Installation guide for Windows users

Thanks to increasing support for ROS on Windows, Gazebo now provides official support to Windows users. The [installation guide](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_on_windows&cat=install) can be a bit tedious to follow and might require some trial-and-error. 

### Installation guide for MacOS users

If you have managed to install ROS on MacOS by following Milestone 1, it may also be also possible to install Gazebo on MacOS as well. Follow the [installation guide](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_on_mac&cat=install) here.

## Gazebo beginner's tutorials

Once you got Gazebo installed successfully, you need to learn how to use Gazebo and run your simulations. 
1. Before you learn about running a full robot simulation using ROS and Gazebo, you will need to learn [how to represent a virtual robot using URDF](https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials)
2. Proceed with [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf) and see if you can get an URDF working in your Gazebo. 
3. Now you will need to understand how you can control your robot via ROS, read [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control) carefully.

In addition, this [Demo Project](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos) provides a working example of the workflow explained in the steps above. 

## Milestone Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria

To demonstrate that you have completed this Milestone, you need to be able to show that you can:
1. Launch Gazebo GUI
2. Construct a simple robot and represent it in URDF. You should also be able to explain your syntax in the URDF.
3. Load and visualize your robot in Gazebo.
4. Move your robot around the simulation environment in Gazebo using a keyboard/mouse/joystick. 

Evaluation will take form in video conference calls or video recordings.
