# Milestone 2 - Basic Robot Simulation with Gazebo

In this Milestone, you are going to learn about [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), a physics engine that allows you to simulate your robots moving through a virtual 3D environment, and hence test your algorithms. 

### Learning Goals

After completing this milestone, you will be able to

* Demonstrate a robot controlled through ROS which moves in the Gazebo simulation.
* List common actuators deployed on robots and their properties.
* List the goals and limitations of actuation components of a robot system.

## Installation

**Ensure you have installed ROS before starting this Milestone** (which you will have done if you completed [M1](../Milestone%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20ROS/M1.md)). The instructions below assume you have installed ROS Melodic, but may work in other versions.

### Installation guide for Linux users

Just like ROS, Gazebo is native to Ubuntu Linux and thus best supported there. The [installation on Ubuntu](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install) is fairly straightforward.
Things to keep in mind are:
* Make sure you install Gazebo related packages that match your [ROS version](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions) (in our case ROS Melodic).

### Installation guide for Windows users

A compatible version of Gazebo should have been installed as part of the `desktop_full` metapackage through chocolatey; for example, the `ros-melodic-desktop_full` metapackage includes the `gazebo-9` package.
* That said, there are still some gotchas.  See [notes from my own experience](notes-windows-M2.md) on my Dell XPS 14 running Windows 10 which you may find useful.

### Installation guide for MacOS users

If you have managed to install ROS on MacOS by following Milestone 1, it may also be also possible to install Gazebo on MacOS as well. Follow the [installation guide](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_on_mac&cat=install) here.

## Gazebo beginner's tutorials

Once you got Gazebo installed successfully, you need to learn how to use Gazebo and run your simulations. 
1. Work through the Beginner tutorials listed on the left side of the [Gazebo Tutorials page](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials):
   1. [Overview and Installation](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b1).
      * You have already completed the installation, so all you need to do is read the "What is Gazebo?" text.
   1. [Understanding the GUI](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b2).
      * For Windows users the `gazebo` command is not defined.  Instead use the command
        ```
        roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
        ```
        to get Gazebo started in an empty world.  (It also creates a ROS master, but you won't use that in these early tutorials.)
   1. [Model Editor](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b3).

1. Learn how robots are represented by ROS and Gazebo.
   1. Learn the basics of the `tf2` package which manages transformation (coordinate) frames in ROS: [Introduction to `tf2`](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf2).  There are many more [`tf2` tutorials](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials) available but you do not need to complete them for this milestone.
   1. 


you will need to learn [how to represent a virtual robot using URDF](https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials)
2. Proceed with [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf) and see if you can get an URDF working in your Gazebo. 
3. Now you will need to understand how you can control your robot via ROS, read [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control) carefully.

In addition, this [Demo Project](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos) provides a working example of the workflow explained in the steps above. 

## Milestone Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria

To demonstrate that you have completed this Milestone, you need to be able to show that you can:
1. Launch Gazebo GUI
2. Construct a simple robot and represent it in URDF. You should also be able to explain your syntax in the URDF.
3. Load and visualize your robot in Gazebo.
4. Move your robot around the simulation environment in Gazebo using a keyboard/mouse/joystick. 

Evaluation will take form in video conference calls or video recordings.
