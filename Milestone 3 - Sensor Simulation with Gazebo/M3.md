# Milestone 3 - Sensor Simulation with Gazebo

It is time to do something more exciting with Gazebo Simulation. In this Milestone, you are going to explore sensor simulation. 

## Prerequisites

By this point we assume that you have successfully completed the last two Milestones. Therefore you should:
* Be able to understand and work with [URDFs](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf).
* Have set up working Gazebo environment.
* Have built a simple robot and be able to control it through ROS and Gazebo.
* Be able to use [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz). 

## Working with Sensors in Gazebo

The main goal of this Milestone is to learn to work with sensors and to make use of sensor data in Gazebo.

### Adding Sensors

Adding sensors to a robot in Gazebo is fairly trivial. Is it as simple as including the sensor in your robot model definition.
A very basic example can be found in [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=add_laser).

### Utilizing Sensor Output
Gazebo plugins give your URDF models greater functionality and can tie in ROS messages and service calls for sensor output and motor input. 
You achieve this by using pre-existing Gazebo Plugins or creating your own customized Plugins. 
Gazebo has provided a very detailed [guide here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins).

### Additional Resources
* You can [create and define your own models](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=model_editor) in Gazebo. 
* You can visualize your sensor data and log it by using [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=drcsim_visualization&cat=drcsim) as an example and try it with your models.
* You can learn more about coordinate frames and how to track them with [ROS tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials).

## Milestone Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria

To demonstrate that you have completed this Milestone, you need to be able to show that you can:
1. Launch Gazebo GUI and show that your robot can have at least one sensor functioning. 
2. Demonstrate that you can view the sensor output in Gazebo and Rviz at the same time.
3. Show that you can have the three types of sensors running with your robot: LRFs, cameras, odometry.

Evaluation will take form in video conference calls or video recordings.
